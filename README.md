# Hana Talent
This is the website of Hana Talent Staffing Agency, built with HTML, CSS(flexbox, and grid), and JavaScript. The entire site is responsive for laptops, tablets, smaller devices, & mobile. What I gained from this project was an immense amount of UI design practice, familiarity with Adobe Illustrator, and Working with a client to exceed their expectations.

This project took me around ten days to come up with the design, develop, and do the entire content writing on all pages. 

Places I see that can be improved is utilizing an async fetch request on the Services page so I not only gain a better understanding of how those specific technologies work, but also to speed up the pages loading response. I also see myself coming back to shift the forms from netlify's form service to a backend server so my client can have a better ease of access to potential clients. I imagine I could also shift the entire site from vanilla JavaScript to a framework like React so as to improve my organization of the code with a component based structure.
